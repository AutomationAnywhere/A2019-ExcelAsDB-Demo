Sample code for dealing with large Excel files from within an A2019 Bot

This code is in support of the Automation Anywhere Dev portal content reviewing different approaches for dealing with large data setsets in Excel.

To use the code:
1. Import the bots from the HugeExcel_AllTest.zip into your control room. They will install in a subdirectory named AAillustrates.
2. Copy the ZipSample.xlsx to C:\temp\LargeExcelTest (need to create the LargeExcelTest folder)

At this point you should be able to run the bots using the default code. Should you need to update the location for the xlsx, each bot would need to be modified to reflect the new file location.

Code is provided as is for demonstration purposes only.
